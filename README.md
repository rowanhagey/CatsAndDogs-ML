# Cat vs. Dog Image Classifier
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based machine learning model that classifies images of cats and dogs. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras with image augmentation to improve generalization.

## Features  
- CNN architecture for binary image classification.  
- Data augmentation to improve model robustness.  
- Batch normalization & dropout to prevent overfitting.  
- Early stopping & learning rate reduction for optimized training.  
- Trained model is saved for future use in predictions.

## Results
After 25 epochs of training we achieved a 89.88% accuracy on our test subset of the image data.
